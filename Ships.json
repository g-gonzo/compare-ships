Nearly a decade after the launch of the Hathaway, the prototype for the class, the USS Constellation, was still undergoing certification trials. \n During the early 24th century, the Constellation-class was noted for performing both deep-space exploration and defensive-patrol duties. By the mid-2360s, this class of \"old-style\" star cruiser was on the fringe of being phased out of the fleet. Those that had been decommissioned, including the eighty-year-old Hathaway, were stripped of their offensive systems and rendered \"warp inactive,\" which included the removal of all antimatter.Those that remained in service were typically relegated to transport duties."

It was first launched during the 2280's and continued to serve as the backbone of Starfleet well into the 2370's. \n When introduced, the Excelsior class was used to carry out Starfleet's \"Great Experiment\": testing a prototype transwarp drive. While the transwarp experiment ultimately failed, the design of the ship proved to be reliable and efficient. After the second vessel of the Excelsior line was christened as the USS Enterprise-B, this class would become one of the most widely recognised ship designs in all of Starfleet, favoured among many members of the fleet's admiralty."

It was intermediate in size between the Excelsior-class and the Galaxy-class. In addition, the class boasted at least three engineering levels. \n A number of Ambassador-class ships were constructed with minor alterations from the original design. The saucer section's connection to the engineering hull was shifted slightly aft, with the nacelle pylon assembly moved a corresponding distance in the same direction. Cowlings were added around the Bussard collectors, making them appear closer to that of the Galaxy-class, while the impulse engine exhaust changed from a blue to a red glow. The lower sensor dome became more elaborate and closer in appearance to the Excelsior-class and the deflector dish was modified. Finally, the width of the shuttlebay was increased and a second facility resembling that on the Excelsior-class engineering hull was mounted directly underneath the original one. Graphics were upgraded with the Starfleet insignia of the 2360s."

These included a gymnasium, a racquetball court, a bar and restaurant, a concert hall, educational facilities and sixteen holodecks. \n This model of starship was designed with two distinct hull sections, the saucer section (primary) and the stardrive section (secondary). In extreme scenarios, the saucer could separate from the stardrive section and operate independently, though could only travel at impulse. In the event of a possible warp core breach, the crew could evacuate to the saucer section which would then separate from the stardrive section before the engine core exploded."

At less than half the size of a Galaxy-class starship, it was considered \"quick and smart.\" \n At the time of its launch, the Intrepid class was the fastest type of ship in Starfleet, capable of cruising at warp 9.975. When first commissioned, it featured many innovations then becoming available, not least being the tricyclic input manifold of the warp core and variable geometry pylons. The class was also the first to incorporate bio-neural gel packs and was equipped with the Mark 1 Emergency Medical Hologram (or EMH) system. Its multi-mission design was backed up by a main computer processor capable of simultaneously accessing 47 million data channels and sustaining 575 trillion calculations per nanosecond in operational temperatures from 10 to 1,790 Kelvin."

The different sections could be controlled remotely from the bridge on the primary section and carry out attack maneauvers based on the helmsman's input."

The nacelles themselves were directly attached to the saucer section by large cowlings, which housed the Bussard collectors. The ship's deflector dish was housed in the rear, on the detached secondary hull, while the bridge module was inset between the Bussard cowlings."
